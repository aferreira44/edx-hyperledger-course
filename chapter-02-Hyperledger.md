# Hyperledger

Hyperledger is a group of open source projects focused around cross-industry distributed ledger technologies. Hosted by The Linux Foundation, collaborators include industry leaders in technology, finance, banking, supply chain management, manufacturing, and IoT.

As of October 2017, Hyperledger consists of eight projects, five of which are distributed ledger frameworks. The other three projects are modules that support these frameworks.

As Arnaud Le Hors, member of the Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee, emphasized,

"these projects show how broadly applicable blockchain technology really is. This goes way beyond cryptocurrencies".

Hyperledger provides an alternative to the cryptocurrency-based blockchain model, and focuses on developing blockchain frameworks and modules to support global enterprise solutions. The focus of Hyperledger is to provide a transparent and collaborative approach to blockchain development.

Key Hyperledger consensus protocols are Apache Kafka in Hyperledger Fabric, PoET in Hyperledger Sawtooth, RBFT in Hyperledger Indy, Tendermint in Hyperledger Burrow, and Yet Another Consensus (YAC) in Hyperledger Iroha.

## Hyperledger Goals

Hyperledger has taken a leadership role to develop cross-industry standards and provide a neutral space for software collaboration. The financial services industry, in particular, is witnessing an unprecedented level of collaboration between institutions that have traditionally been competitors. The advent of a new foundational or infrastructural technology like the blockchain - much like the Internet - requires collaboration of various actors in order to realize the full benefits of the technology. Unless all actors use a certain standard, the pace of technological dissemination will continue to be slow. Technological adoption is characterized by network effects, where the costs decrease with the increase in use of a certain technology. Since shifting to distributed ledger technology involves significant costs, open source software, communities and ecosystems that develop around these have a significant part to play.

## Open Standards

"Only an Open Source, collaborative software development approach can ensure the transparency, longevity, interoperability and support required to bring blockchain technologies forward to mainstream commercial adoption. That is what Hyperledger is about - communities of software developers building blockchain frameworks and platforms."

As we learned in Chapter 1: Discovering Blockchain Technologies, the non-availability of standards in distributed ledger technologies is one of the major hurdles in scaling them. One of Hyperledger's key goals is to facilitate the process of standards formation, not by promoting its own distributed ledger(s), but by providing a space for a variety of standards to co-exist simultaneously:

"Rather than declaring a single blockchain standard, it encourages a collaborative approach to developing blockchain technologies via a community process, with intellectual property rights that encourage open development and the adoption of key standards over time."

Hyperledger aims to adhere to 'open standards', which means they are

"(...) interoperable through open published interfaces and services."

## Open Source and Open Governance

"Today, most people understand the concept of Open Source. What many people don't get, and something we here at Hyperledger and The Linux Foundation pride ourselves on doing well, is Open Governance."

- [hyperledger.org](hyperledger.org)

Open source software is software that is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified. In other words, anyone has the ability to view the code, use the code, copy the code, change the code, and, depending on the open source license, contribute back changes.

Open governance means that technical decisions for an open source project are made by a group of community-elected developers drawn from a pool of active participants. These decisions include things such as which features to add, how, and when to add them.

## Blockchain for Business

The cryptocurrency-based blockchain model, popularized by public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, currently falls short of fulfilling a host of requirements that many types of organizations would have to fulfill in order to be compliant when using blockchain and distributed ledger technologies - for instance, in the areas of financial services, healthcare, and government.

Hyperledger is a unique platform that is developing permissioned distributed ledger frameworks specifically designed for enterprises, including those in industries with strong compliance requirements. Enterprise use cases require capabilities such as scalability and throughput, built-in or interoperable identity modules for the parties involved in a transaction or a network, or even access to regulators who can access all data in the ledger as read-only to ensure compliance. The latter is particularly important because, regardless of the innovation, it has to operate within the current regulatory framework, as well as comply with any new rules that come into place specifically targeted at blockchain technologies.

The enterprise continues to be at the heart of this course.
