# Introduction

## Hyperledger

Hyperledger is the umbrella open source project that The Linux Foundation has created and hosted since 2015. It aims at advancing and promoting cross-industry blockchain technologies to ensure accountability, transparency, and trust among business partners. As a result, Hyperledger makes business network and transactions more efficient.

These benefits are valued by leaders across many industries, including technology, finance, healthcare, supply chain, and automotive, among several others.

Hyperledger offers different blockchain platforms. This course will present three of them: Iroha, Sawtooth, and Fabric.

## The Linux Foundation

The Linux Foundation partners with the world's leading developers and companies to solve the hardest technology problems and accelerate open technology development and commercial adoption. The Linux Foundation makes it its mission to provide experience and expertise to any initiative working to solve complex problems through open source collaboration, providing the tools to scale open source projects: security best practices, governance, operations and ecosystem development, training and certification, licensing, and promotion.

Linux is the world's largest and most pervasive open source software project in history. The Linux Foundation is home to Linux creator Linus Torvalds and lead maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman, and provides a neutral home where Linux kernel development can be protected and accelerated for years to come. The success of Linux has catalyzed growth in the open source community, demonstrating the commercial efficacy of open source and inspiring countless new projects across all industries and levels of the technology stack.

The Linux Foundation's work today extends far beyond Linux, fostering innovation at every layer of the software stack. The Linux Foundation is the umbrella organization for many critical open source projects that power corporations today, spanning all industry sectors:

Big data and analytics: ODPi, R Consortium
Networking: OpenDaylight, OPNFV
Embedded: Dronecode, Zephyr
Web tools: JS Foundation, Node.js
Cloud computing: Cloud Foundry, Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Open Container Initiative
Automotive: Automotive Grade Linux
Security: The Core Infrastructure Initiative
Blockchain: Hyperledger
And many more.
