## Defining Our Actors

- Sarah is the fisherman who sustainably and legally catches tuna.
- Regulators verify that the tuna has been legally and sustainably caught.
- Miriam is a restaurant owner who will serve as the end user, in this situation.
- Carl is another restaurant owner fisherman Sarah can sell tuna to.

Using Hyperledger Fabric, we will be demonstrating how tuna fishing can be improved starting from the source, fisherman Sarah, and the process by which she sells her tuna to Miriam's restaurant.
