# Challenges in the Adoption/Deployment of Distributed Ledger Technologies

[Distributed Ledger Technologies/Blockchain: Challenges, opportunities and the prospects for standards](https://www.bsigroup.com/PageFiles/508003/BSI_Blockchain_DLT_Web.pdf)

There are a number of challenges to the widespread use of permissioned distributed ledger technologies. Key among them are challenges around the lack of standards, regulatory challenges, and the lack of knowledge about distributed ledger technologies. These challenges are inherent to any new technological infrastructure that replaces an older infrastructure.

We hope you go on to address some of these challenges and contribute to building a secure digital future!

## Standards

Since we are still witnessing the early days of blockchain technology, there is no agreement on standards in the developer and business community, as of yet. Standards are key in ensuring interoperability and avoiding risks associated with a fragmented ecosystem. Standards are critical not just for the distributed ledger itself, but also for supporting services, like identity, privacy, and data governance. Furthermore, the management of keys, as well as protocols and standards around key loss and theft, will be critical (Deshpande, Stewart, Lepetit, & Gunashekar, 2017).

As a result, the International Organization for Standardization for Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies was established in 2016 and has defined areas for future standardization work ([Clare Naden, 2017](https://www.iso.org/news/Ref2188.htm)).

## Regulation

The lack of regulation around transactions on the blockchain creates an environment of uncertainty for all players. Highly regulated industries like financial services are treading carefully in the DLT space. The Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States has recently clarified its stance (sec.gov) on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). The Chinese government has, in fact, banned all ICOs, while 60 major ICO platforms are being investigated (Saheli Roy Choudhury, 2017).

Similarly, there are no regulatory guidelines governing smart contracts, causing much anxiety among various players like lawyers, regulators, programmers, and businesses. The lack of regulatory guidelines, along with a lack of industry standards, exacerbates hindrances to rapid adoption of DLT.

## Lack of Know-How

The lack of know-how (and know-whom and know-where) around distributed ledger technologies and the availability of experts in the area is a major challenge in the adoption of distributed ledger technologies. While there has been an exponential increase in the interest around 'blockchain', as indicated in the figure below, there is a huge lag of technical talent in the space. In fact, the origin of this course stems from the need to address this gap in know-how, both for the business and technical audiences.
